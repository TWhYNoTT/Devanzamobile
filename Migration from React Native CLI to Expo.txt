Migration from React Native CLI to Expo
1. Overview
Goal: Migrate the project from React Native CLI to Expo, focusing exclusively on the UI/UX while ensuring compatibility with Expo.
Expo App Setup: Created using npx create-expo-app@latest --template blank-typescript.
2. Migration Considerations
Convert all code to functional components.
Migrate to TypeScript for type safety.
Use the latest versions of all libraries and packages.
Follow best practices in development.
Ensure compatibility with Expo for all libraries and packages:
Heavily prioritize Expo-compatible packages.
Use alternatives if a package is incompatible with Expo.
Replace outdated or deprecated packages with updated, supported alternatives.
Always use the latest version of Expo.
3. Handling Incompatible or Unsupported Features
Packages:

If a package is incompatible with Expo, use an Expo-compatible package or find an alternative.
Remove deprecated packages and replace them with supported, compatible ones.
Replace packages and functionality that rely on APIs or servers with dummy data.
Replace any functionality that rely on APIs or servers with simulated behavior.

UI/UX Components:

Use Expo-compatible layout components instead of React Native layout components.
Rewrite any unsupported component to be compatible with Expo or use an alternative.
Unsupported Features:

Remove any functionality related to:
API integration.
Server interaction.
External factors for operation.
Replace such functionality with dummy data.
4. State Management
Do not use Redux, Redux Toolkit, or reducers.
Avoid using Saga and any related middleware.
Instead, use local state management (e.g., Reactâ€™s useState and useReducer hooks).
5. Structure and Naming
Retain the existing project structure and naming conventions.
6. Preferred Libraries
Core Packages to Use:
expo-status-bar
expo-haptics
react-native-safe-area-context
react-native-size-matters
@react-navigation/native
