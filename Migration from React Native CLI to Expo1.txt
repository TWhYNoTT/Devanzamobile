Migration from React Native CLI to Expo
1. Overview
Goal: Migrate the project from React Native CLI to Expo, focusing exclusively on the UI/UX while ensuring compatibility with Expo.
Expo App Setup: Created using npx create-expo-app@latest --template blank-typescript.
2. Migration Considerations
Convert all code to functional components.
Migrate to TypeScript for type safety.
Use the latest versions of all libraries and packages.
Follow best practices in development.
Ensure compatibility with Expo for all libraries and packages:
Heavily prioritize Expo-compatible packages.
Use alternatives if a package is incompatible with Expo.
Replace outdated or deprecated packages with updated, supported alternatives.
Always use the latest version of Expo.
Replace functionality that rely on APIs or servers with dummy data and simulated behavior.

dont Remove any functionality related to:
dont remove translate functionality.
dont remove validation functionality.
dont remove utility functions.


3. Handling Incompatible or Unsupported Features
Packages:
If a package is incompatible with Expo, use an Expo-compatible package or find an alternative.
Remove deprecated packages and replace them with supported, compatible ones.
Replace packages and functionality that rely on APIs or servers with dummy data and simulated behavior.

UI/UX Components:
Use Expo-compatible layout components instead of React Native layout components.




4. State Management
Do not use Redux, Redux Toolkit, or reducers.
Avoid using Saga and any related middleware.
Instead, use local state management (e.g., Reactâ€™s useState and useReducer hooks).
5. Structure and Naming
Retain the existing project structure and naming conventions.
6. Preferred Libraries
Core Packages to Use:
expo-status-bar
expo-haptics
react-native-safe-area-context
react-native-size-matters
@react-navigation/native
react-native-reanimated-carousel
expo-firebase-core
expo-notifications
expo-blur
expo-localization
expo-image
react-native-elements
luxon
@gorhom/bottom-sheet
react-native-reanimated
expo-location
react-native-paper
react-native-gesture-handler
Replace unsupported packages with Expo-compatible alternatives.

expected errors and its solutions

(NOBRIDGE) ERROR  Warning: Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
Check the render method of Browse.

The issue might be with the HeaderImageScrollView package. For Expo projects, I recommend replacing it with a custom implementation using ScrollView and Animated.
